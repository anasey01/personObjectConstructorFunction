# personObjectConstructorFunction
A person object constructor function that takes in first name, last name, age, gender and interests as a parameter and outputs a string as data. It's quite interesting because what it outputs, depends on the user's gender and number of interests the user might have. Interests can go as much as 1 to a million, 2 million interests. Basically, it's dynamic.
